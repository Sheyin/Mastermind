Mastermind
==========

A Mastermindâ„¢ clone I wrote up for practice.
This is my second project ever written while learning Java, so it's not likely to be optimized - though I *think* I have caught and worked out all the bugs (save one).

Known Bugs: You can enter multiple colors on a peg line, but it will not prompt you to correct that or save them to other pegs; it will only recognize and process the first color listed.)  I'm pretty sure I can fix that in time, but I'm just getting to that section in the book I'm studying, so since it's fairly minor I'm leaving that fix for later.

Usage: /java Mastermind

Gameplay/Rules: (these are also printed when you run the program)
<br \>1. The program randomly selects four colors.  Duplicate colors are allowed.
<br \>2. You select four colors.
<br \>3. The program provides feedback to help you narrow down your guesses.
  - black peg: right color, right position
  - white peg: right color, wrong position
  - no peg: wrong color, wrong position
  - white/black peg order does not correspond to the order of your guesses.
  - no feedback is given on duplicates unless you also enter a duplicate color.</ol>
<br \>4. If your guess matches the hidden code, you win!

Special thanks goes out to my beta testers (my little nephews).
